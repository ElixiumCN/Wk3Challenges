<!-- [creative freedom on this, so use gif files for win and loss]

List the things to do again with my new knowledge:

Interface elements required:

- Button for dice roll
- e.g. P tag for showing score
- e.g. P tag for showing win or loss text

- as simple as possible at first, just text for win or lose.. no images.

Criteria
> Roll the dice to begin the game. [x]
> The dice appears on the first roll. [x]
> When a dice is rolled, the score adds up. [x]
> Once the score passes 20, you win. [x]
> However, if you hit ‘1’ then you lose (if less than score of 20). [x]
> If the player won or lost, the player can start the game again. [x]
> You may want to change the score to any number other than 20 [x]

These criteria must be met:
######> Roll the dice to begin the game. [x]
A button that calls the diceroll function 
- Done.

######>> The dice appears on the first roll. [x]
- Done with 2 seperate methods I know about - hidden div & create element.

######>> When a dice is rolled, the score adds up. [x]

return the dice roll and show as text. 
set score variable, if score = win then show win text.
increment score variable with result.

######>> Once the score passes 20, you win. [x]


######>> However, if you hit ‘1’ then you lose (if less than score of 20). [x]
--- replace youLose element with a string "You Lose"

######>> If the player won or lost, the player can start the game again. [x]
-- if the game ends, create element for start new game element

######>> You may want to change the score to any number other than 20 [x]


Bugfixes:
    - Score now immediately begins counting counting on the first roll,
    the score addition line of code hasn't high up enough in the dice roll function.

















    1. List all the things I'll use to produce this e.g. button.

1 Player Game

These criteria must be met:
##############> Roll the dice to begin the game.
A button that calls the diceroll function

##############> The dice appears on the first roll.
the roll function makes a div containing a dice appear []

##############> When a dice is rolled, the score adds up.

score Variable  that is incremented (addition operator) by the result of the dice roll.
a function that takes the output of the diceroll function and stores it in a score variable and everytime the diceroll function is run, it takes the diceroll output & applies an addition operator to the score variable
- How to pass the result of a function to a variable.

##############> Once the score passes 20, you win.
when the score variable exceeds 20 call a win function

##############> However, if you hit ‘1’ then you lose (if less than score of 20).
if the dice roll results in 1 then call the 


##############> If [conditional statement] the player won or lost, the player can start the game again.
##############> You may want to change the score to any number other than 20



2 Player Game

These criteria must be met:
> Click ‘New Game’ to begin.
> Player 1 goes first. You can roll the dice however many times you
wish.
>In the ‘Current’ box, it gives you the current score as you roll the
dice.
>When it hits a certain score, player 1 may want to ‘hold’ the
score, which will then appear in the middle of player 1 as the total
score so for, player 1 cannot roll anymore. Player 2 begins to roll.
> If the player hits ‘1’ without holding any score, the current score
will reset, and the next player begins to roll again.
> Once one of the players hits 20 or more score, that player wins! -->
